<h2> This is the GitHub Repository for the Games4U E-Commerce Website </h2>

<h3> Project Brief: </h3>
The main aim of Games4U is to allow users to purchase games easily through use of our website. We strive to produce a website that is both easy to use and visually appealing to our potential customer base. The audience we are hoping to reach is people who play games both casually and competitively. We also aim to reach people who know someone who plays games such as parents or partners.
